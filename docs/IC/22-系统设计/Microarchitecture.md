In [computer engineering]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_engineering "Computer engineering"), **microarchitecture**, also called **computer organization** and sometimes abbreviated as **µarch** or **uarch**, is the way a given [instruction set architecture]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture "Instruction set architecture") (ISA) is implemented in a particular [processor]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit "Central processing unit"). A given ISA may be implemented with different microarchitectures;  implementations may vary due to different goals of a given design or due to shifts in technology. 

[Computer architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture "Computer architecture") is the combination of microarchitecture and instruction set architecture.
