# Skew group
#Skew_group is nothing but a group of clock sinks.  The clocks which have similar source (and which are synchronous to each other) are placed in a group.

However, two different groups are logically exclusive.

Hence, the tool will try to improve skew and balance latencies of the groups independently.
