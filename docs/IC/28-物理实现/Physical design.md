RTL is only a behavioral model of the actual functionality of what the chip is supposed to operate under. It has no link to a physical aspect of how the chip would operate in real life at the materials, physics, and electrical engineering side. For this reason, the next step in the IC design process, [physical design]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_design_ (electronics) "Physical design (electronics)") stage, is to map the RTL into actual geometric representations of all electronics devices, such as capacitors, resistors, logic gates, and transistors that will go on the chip.

The main steps of physical design are listed below. In practice there is not a straightforward progression - considerable iteration is required to ensure all objectives are met simultaneously. This is a difficult problem in its own right, called [design closure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_closure "Design closure").

-   [Logic synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_synthesis "Logic synthesis"): The RTL is mapped into a gate-level netlist in the target technology of the chip.
-   [Floorplanning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floorplan_(microelectronics) "Floorplan (microelectronics)"): The RTL of the chip is assigned to gross regions of the chip, input/output (I/O) pins are assigned and large objects (arrays, cores, etc.) are placed.
-   [Placement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placement_(EDA) "Placement (EDA)"): The gates in the netlist are assigned to nonoverlapping locations on the die area.
-   Logic/placement refinement: Iterative logical and placement transformations to close performance and power constraints.
-   [Clock insertion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_Distribution_Networks "Clock Distribution Networks"): Clock signal wiring is (commonly, [clock trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_tree "Clock tree")) introduced into the design.
-   [Routing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_(EDA) "Routing (EDA)"): The wires that connect the gates in the netlist are added.
-   Postwiring optimization: Performance ([timing closure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_closure "Timing closure")), noise ([signal integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_integrity "Signal integrity")), and yield ([Design for manufacturability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_for_manufacturability_(IC) "Design for manufacturability (IC)")) violations are removed.
-   [Design for manufacturability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_for_manufacturability_(IC) "Design for manufacturability (IC)"): The design is modified, where possible, to make it as easy and efficient as possible to produce. This is achieved by adding extra vias or adding dummy metal/diffusion/poly layers wherever possible while complying to the design rules set by the foundry.
-   Final checking: Since errors are expensive, time-consuming and hard to spot, extensive error checking is the rule, [making sure the mapping to logic was done correctly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_equivalence_checking "Formal equivalence checking"), and [checking that the manufacturing rules were followed faithfully](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_rule_checking "Design rule checking").
-   Chip finishing with [Tapeout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tape-out "Tape-out") and mask generation: the design data is turned into [photomasks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photomask "Photomask") in [mask data preparation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask_data_preparation "Mask data preparation").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit_design#cite_note-Layout_book2-1)
