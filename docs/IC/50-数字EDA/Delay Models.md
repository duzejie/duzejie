## Delay Models

#### Delay Calculation

- The delay calculation is needed because of complex Input Capacitance, Voltage Drop, Voltage Islands, High Impedance nets etc.
- Delay calculation parameter data are stored as Lookup-Table format

#### Delay Models

**Interconnect Delay Models**

- Lumped RCL Delay Models
- Wire Load Delay (WLD) Model
- Elmore Delay Model
- Arnoldi Delay Model

**Cell Delay Models**

- Non-Linear Delay Model (NLDM)
- Scalable Polynomial Delay Model (SPDM)
- Effective Current Source Model (ECSM)
- Composite Current Source (CCS) Delay Model
